This is a kernel driver for the Corsair HX 850i. It should work on many other Corsair PSUs, but I don't have them available to test.
It was derived from Marius Zachmann's <mail@mariuszachmann.de> driver for the commander pro, as well as Sean Nelson's <audiohacked@gmail.com> work on the RMi series PSUs in OpenCorsairLink

Features:

Read connected thermal sensors.
Read voltage, current, and power values.

If you would like to test it, clone the repository.
make && sudo insmod corsair-hxi-psu.ko

If you run sensors, it should show up.

Features in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*
temp*_input shows the temperature.
in0_label voltage on 12v rail
in1_label voltage on 5v rail
in2_label voltage on 3.3v rail
The same correspond for curr*_input, and power*_input
For each, the *3_input is for the whole PSU as measured from the wall

What it cannot do (yet):
Recognize fans, read fan speeds.
Set fan speed, change fan control mode
Get/set per-rail OCP settings
